# Bootcamp-Unit-1-Challenge

## Description

This is the challenge assignment for Unit 1 of the DU Coding Bootcamp. The objective was to refactor the code for better search engine priority and readability. I learned that semantic elements are important and writing the stylesheet using mostly class/id assignments will help with not having to edit the stylesheet when refactoring the elements in the HTML.
